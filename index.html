		So, we’ll go no more a-roving
		&nbsp;So late into the night,
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the heart be still as loving,
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the moon be still as bright.
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sword outwears its sheath,
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the soul wears out the breast,
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the heart must pause to breathe,
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And love itself have rest.
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the night was made for loving,
		&nbsp;And the day returns too soon,
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet we’ll go no more a-roving
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the light of the moon.
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we’ll go no more a-roving

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the heart be still as loving,
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the moon be still as bright.
