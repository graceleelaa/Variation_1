		&nbsp;So, we’ll go no more a-roving <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;So late into the night, <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the heart be still as loving,<br>
		And the moon be still as bright.<br>
		For the sword outwears its sheath,<br>
		And the soul wears out the breast,<br>
		And the heart must pause to breathe,<br>
		And love itself have rest.<br>
		Though the night was made for loving,<br>
		And the day returns too soon,<br>
		Yet we’ll go no more a-roving<br>
		By the light of the moon.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		So, we’ll go no more a-roving<br>
		So late into the night,<br>
		Though the heart be still as loving,<br>
        And the moon be still as bright.<br>
		For the sword outwears its sheath,<br>
		And the soul wears out the breast,<br>
		And the heart must pause to breathe,<br>
		And love itself have rest.<br>
		Though the night was made for loving,<br>
		And the day returns too soon,<br>
		Yet we’ll go no more a-roving<br>
		By the light of the moon.<br>

		So, we’ll go no more a-roving
		So late into the night,
		Though the heart be still as loving,
		And the moon be still as bright.
		For the sword outwears its sheath,
		And the soul wears out the breast,
		And the heart must pause to breathe,
		And love itself have rest.
		Though the night was made for loving,
		And the day returns too soon,
		Yet we’ll go no more a-roving
		By the light of the moon.
